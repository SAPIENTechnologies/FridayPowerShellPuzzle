#  Friday Puzzle: Phantom Help

On Friday, December 16, 2016, I posted the following puzzle on Twitter and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SAPIENTech/photos/a.10151095012027283.433079.82797372282/10154148014982283/?type=3).

It shows a function that has no comment-based help or XML help, but when you run Get-Help on the function, Get-Help displays both a description and notes for the function.

What is the source of help for this function? I call this unintentional help “phantom help.”
