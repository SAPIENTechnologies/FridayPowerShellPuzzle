# Friday Puzzle: What's Wrong with this Pester Test?

On Friday, March 17, 2017, I posted the following puzzle on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juneb_get_help/status/842734146669559810) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SAPIENTech/posts/10154395256272283) (and [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/powershell/permalink/1383272985064209/)!).

It shows a PowerShell Get-Profile.ps1 script and a matching Pester test script, Get-Profile.Tests.ps1, that tests the functions in the Get-Profile.ps1 script. The test file contains a Describe block with a Mock and two It blocks for assertions that claim to test the Get-Profile function in Get-Profile.ps1.

The puzzle asks: What's wrong with this Pester test? Can you tell?
