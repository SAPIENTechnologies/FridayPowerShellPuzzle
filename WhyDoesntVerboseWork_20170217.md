#Friday Puzzle Solution: Why doesn’t Verbose work?

On Friday, February 17, 2017, I posted the following puzzle on Twitter and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SAPIENTech/photos/a.10151095012027283.433079.82797372282/10154321647172283/?type=3&permPage=1) (and [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/powershell/permalink/1353565894701585/?match=YmxlbmRlcix2ZXJib3Nl)!).

It shows a PowerShell function with a [**Write-Verbose**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/3.0/microsoft.powershell.utility/write-verbose) command and asks “Why won’t the verbose string print?

You might think of this as a beginner puzzle, but after years of using PowerShell, I still hit this issue occasionally, and I’ve seen functions in the PowerShell Gallery just like this one.
