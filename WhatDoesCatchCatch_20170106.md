# Friday Puzzle: What does a Catch block catch?

On Friday, January 6, 2017, I posted the following puzzle on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juneb_get_help/status/817413653540417538) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SAPIENTech/photos/a.10151095012027283.433079.82797372282/10154206375342283/?type=3) ([here, too!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/powershell/permalink/1309709699087205/)).

It shows a **Try** block that encloses an expression with an intentional error and a **Catch** block that writes an error. But, when you run it, the error doesn’t appear as designed.

The error is supposed to say ‘Cannot multiply by apple.’ But, it doesn’t. What went wrong here?
