Featuring SAPIEN Friday PowerShell Puzzles (without the solutions)

This [SAPIEN Technologies repository](https://github.com/sapientechnologies) features the Friday PowerShell Puzzles that we post on Facebook and Twitter. The solutions always appear in the [SAPIEN blog](https://www.sapien.com/blog/topics/puzzle/), but we wanted to give you a chance to have fun with the puzzles independent of their solutions. Each puzzle topic links to the solution as soon as it's published, but we never include the solutions here.

So, here they are!

- [What does Return return?](https://github.com/SAPIENTechnologies/FridayPowerShellPuzzle/blob/master/WhatDoesReturnReturn_20170203.md)
- [Why doesn't Include include?](https://github.com/SAPIENTechnologies/FridayPowerShellPuzzle/blob/master/WhyDoesntIncludeInclude_20170120.md)
